(http://www.ldraw.org/) and "Train Depot Track Designer"
(http://www.ngltc.org/Train_Depot/td.htm) and was designed to extend easily
its part database. Its layers feature allow you to better organize your map,
and some specific layers make possible the addition of annotation and area
assignment.

2) Install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: you can refer to the BlueBrick website (http://bluebrick.lswproject.com/),
in the Download section, for detailed install instructions with pictures.

2.1) Windows Vista or Windows 7, 8 or 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nothing special need to be install first. Simply extract the files contained in
the zip, somewhere on your hardrive, by keeping the same folders organization.
Then double click on the BlueBrick.exe file in the install folder to run
BlueBrick.

2.2) Windows XP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
a) First, you need to download and install the Microsoft .NET FrameWork (at
least version 4.0), that can be found on the Microsoft website (if not already
installed on your machine):
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851

b) Then extract the files contained in the BlueBrick zip file, somewhere on
your hardrive, by keeping the same folders organization.

c) Double click on the BlueBrick.exe file in the install folder.

2.3) Linux
~~~~~~~~~~
a) You need to install Mono for Linux first. I suggest you to use the Software
Center, and search for "MonoDevelop".

a.bis) If you want to be able to open the documentation file, you should also
install a CHM reader, for example "xCHM" which can also be installed from the
Software Center.

b) Unzip the BlueBrick zip file somewhere on your hardrive, for example
in ~/BlueBrick

c) Then you should run the "linux-install.sh" shell script inside the install
folder. This will create a BlueBrick.desktop shortcut on your Desktop. Once the
shortcut is created, simply double click it to run BlueBrick.

c.bis) Or simply, if you don't want to create a shortcut, to run BlueBrick in
a Terminal Shell, type:
$ mono BlueBrick.exe &

2.4) Mac OSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~
a) You need to install Mono for Mac first which you can download here:
http://www.mono-project.com/download/

If you want some help on installing Mono on MaC OSX, please visit:
http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/osx/

If you got some DllNotFoundException error, please read the following page
to learn how to solve it:
http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/dllnotfoundexception/

a.bis) If you want to be able to open the documentation file, you should also
install a CHM reader, for example: 
"iCHM" (http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/28171/ichm)
or "Chmox" (http://chmox.sourceforge.net/).

b) Unzip the BlueBrick zip file somewhere on your hardrive.

c) To run BlueBrick, in a Terminal Shell type, go to the BlueBrick installation
folder using the "cd" command then type:
$ mono BlueBrick.exe

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Help
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please refer to the help file that comes with the application (menu Help > 
Content and Index...)
For Linux and Mac user, you should install a CHM reader, in order to be able

- BUGFIX (Didier): when draging a part from the part library and drop it on the border of the main window, then it is not possible to select it. In fact the bug was: when you drag a part from the part library, then move the mouse outside of the main window and release the button, the part is not selectionnable, not undoable, and in fact disapear if you drag another part.
- BUGFIX (Didier): The baseplate 48x48 has the same size as a 32x32 (thank you for reminding me this bug, well since only this part has this size, I was thinking it will reduce the size of all the parts only for this one... What a pity :-( ) But Anyway I fix it, you can tell me if you still think it is ok.
