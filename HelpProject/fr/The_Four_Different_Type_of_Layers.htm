<H1>The Four Different Type of Layers</H1>
<BR>

<H2>Text Layers</H2>
<P>Text Layers are useful for labeling sections of your layout 10. Press 3 and then double click inside the layer pane to open the text box window. Write in the text and change the font properties as desired. Press Ok to close the window and then move the text into position with the mouse. To change the font properties double click on the text layer tab 8. The text can also be rotated, by using the rotate buttons, and rotation settings.</P>

<H2>Grid Layers</H2>
<P>By default, a new layout always starts with an initial Grid Layer with a white grid 11. You can add more grid layers by pressing 4. These layers are always transparent and contain grid coordinates. You can access the grid and text options by double clicking on the grid's layer tab 8. You can change the background color through the <FONT CLASS="path">&nbsp;edit &gt; map background&nbsp;</FONT> menu. See the <A HREF="Appearance_Option.htm">Appearance Option</A> section for more details. If you do not want a new layout to contain a grid layer by default, you can change this in the <A HREF="General_Option.htm">general options</A>. An additional grid layer may be useful if you want to have your horizontal and vertical grid coordinates indicated on separate layers so you can hide one or the other.</P>

<H2>Area Layers</H2>
<P>Area layers are useful to mark or reserve sections in or around your layout which are not necessarily needed for Lego, or a part of your fixed layout 12. These sections are marked using the paint tool. You can change the color by simply clicking on the paint tool button 14, or you can select the color you need from the <FONT CLASS="path">&nbsp;edit &gt; paint tool... &gt; choose color&nbsp;</FONT> menu. Double clicking on the Area Layer tab will provide you with transparency settings and the size of the brush stroke in studs. In the above screenshot the area is marked to indicate the location of the 9V controller.</P> 
<P>The whole area can be moved by holding down the CTRL Button (by default), and dragging it to new location using the mouse. Note that the entire contents of the area layer will be moved.</P>
<P>The painted areas can be erased by clicking on the arrow next to the paint tool button 16, and selecting the erase tool. 
</P>

<H2>Brick Layers</H2>
<P>Brick layers are used to create the actual Lego layout. Having several layers can make complex layouts easier to edit and organize.  In the above screenshot, 3 separate brick layers were used. One for the table using custom parts, one for roads and buildings, and one for the track itself. This feature is also useful if you have layouts which combine several types of track. For example, you can use 1 layer for 9V, 1 for 12V and one for the monorail. The contents of each layer can be moved independently from other layers.</P>
