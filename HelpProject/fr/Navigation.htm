<P>BlueBrick was designed to make the navigation on the <A HREF="Window_Panes.htm">Layout pane</A> as easy as possible. This applies especially to those what have a mouse with 3 buttons and a wheel, but of course it is still possible to use BlueBrick on a laptop with a touchpad. In this section you will learn how to <A HREF="Zooming_and_Viewing.htm">zoom and pan the view</A>, and how to <A HREF="Selecting_Parts.htm">select parts</A>.</P>
