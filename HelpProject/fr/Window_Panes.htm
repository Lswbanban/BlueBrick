<H1>Window Panes</H1>
<P>BlueBrick consists of the following 3 window panes: the Layout pane, the Parts pane and the Layer pane. The use of these panes will be discussed in detail later in the <A HREF="Creating_and_Modifying_Models.htm">Creating and Modifying Models</A> section.</P>

<H2>The Layout pane</H2>
<P>The layout pane is located on the left side of the screen and is recognizable by its standard blue background and white grid layout. This pane offers an adjustable "snap to" grid feature which will help you align the various elements of your track layout.</P>

<H2>The Parts pane </H2>
<P>The parts pane is located at the top right of the main window and consists of several category tabs that organize the available parts. If you would like to contribute to the parts list please <A HREF="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=33157">click here</A>. The "Custom" tab currently provides 3 different sizes of table surfaces. The sizes represent the number of 32x32 Lego base plates that fit on the surface.</P>
<P>Please note that these tabs will always appear in English no matter which language is chosen for the software. This is because the titles reflect the names of the folders in which the parts are located. If you rename the subfolders in the BlueBrick parts folder, this change will be reflected in the tab titles.</P>
<P>Right clicking the parts pane will make the thumbnails smaller so you see more parts at any one time.</P>

<H2>The Layer pane</H2>
<P>The Layer pane is located at the bottom right corner. This feature is especially useful for more complicated layouts. In this pane you can add, remove and organize the various layers that you need. Details can be found in the <A HREF="Creating_and_Using_Layers.htm">Creating and Using Layers</A> section.</P>
