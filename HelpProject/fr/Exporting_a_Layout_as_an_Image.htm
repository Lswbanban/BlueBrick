<H2>Exporting</H2>

<P>Exporting a Layout as an Image can be handy when you do not, or can not print your layout and you need to show your layout on hardware that either does not have, or cannot support BlueBrick.  It is also useful if you want to add your layouts to picture archives (e.g. Online). This feature can be found in the <FONT CLASS="path">&nbsp;file &gt; export picture...&nbsp;</FONT> menu. </P>

<P>The options window gives you the possibility to select the section of your layout which you want to have exported. Simply click and drag the mouse over the image to place a red frame around the area you want to save. You can make a more precise selection by using the "Area Size in Studs" boxes to lower left of the window.</P>

<P>You can also enter the required dimensions of resulting picture. This may be important if you want the image to fit the monitor you are using. To do this simply type in the resolution of your monitor in the "Image Size in Pixel" section. Note that you only need to type in the width or height. The program will automatically calculate the other dimension based on the size of the selection you have made. </P>

<P>Supported file types are .bmp, .jpg, .gif and .png.</P>

<H2>Printing</H2>

<P>Printing the layout can be done by printing the image you saved using the "Export picture..." feature. You can open the picture using the standard picture viewing software provided with you operating system and print it from there.</P>
