<P><B>Adding</B> Parts can be done in 3 different ways. It can be done by simply dragging the desired part from the parts pane onto the layout pane (see the <A HREF="Window_Panes.htm">Window Panes</A> section for more details), or by left clicking on the parts in the parts pane (the part will be added to the left of the active selection), or by using a short cut key. For example "S" will insert straight  9V track to the left of the active selection. You can also configure short cut keys yourself (see the <A HREF="Shortcut_Keys.htm">Shortcut Keys</A> section for more details).</P>

<P><B>Delete, Cut, Copy and Paste</B> functions are provided by buttons 6 though 9 as well as the shortcut keys you are familiar with from other software products. E.g. CTRL + C for Copy and CTRL + V for Paste. You can also copy parts by duplicating them. This is done by selecting a part, pressing the duplicate key (ALT by default), then dragging the parts with the mouse and letting it go at the point where you want the part to be placed. Parts can also be cut or copied from one layer into another.</P>

<P><B>Duplicating</B> parts and text can be done by selecting and holding a part with the left mouse button, then holding down the ALT key, moving the mouse to where the duplicated part is to be located and letting go. When active, the duplicate function is identified by a small "+" next to the mouse cursor while pressing the ALT key (by default), when the cursor is above the selected parts.</P>

<P>All these actions can be undone and redone, see the <A HREF="Undo_and_Redo.htm">Undo and Redo</A> section for more details.</P>
