<P>Un-doing and Re-doing actions can be done using buttons 4 and 5 respectively or with the classical shortcut CTRL + Z and CTRL + Y. You can also undo or redo several steps at once. For that, you click on the downward arrow next to the undo (or redo) button and select an undo or redo point from the list. This function is similar to other software such as MS Office and Internet Explorer.</P>
