<H1>Selecting Parts</H1>

<P>General selection works the same for Brick and Text layers. You can select individual parts by clicking on them, or multiple parts by dragging the mouse over parts you need (forming a selection rectangle).</P>

<P>Selecting multiple parts can be done by <FONT CLASS="Important">holding the CTRL key</FONT> (by default), and clicking on the parts with the left mouse button. Holding the CTRL Key and clicking on an already selected part will unselect it.</P>

<P>You can also select a group of parts by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse so that the desired parts are inside the rectangular selection box. You can make multiple group selections by holding the CTRL key (by default), when dragging additional selection boxes. If you do not hold the CTRL key the previous selection box will disappear.  If two selection boxes overlap, that do not contain the same parts, then all selected parts will be merged into one large selection box. Dragging a selection box over parts that have already been selected will deselect them.</P>
