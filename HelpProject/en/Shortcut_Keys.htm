<P><B>Adding Shortcut Keys</B> can be done using the 4 drop down menus at the bottom of the Shortcut list (fig. 9c). Choose each the Key on you keyboard to which you would like to assign the function 1, then which function this key is supposed to perform 2, the part or set number which it will use 3, and the connection type it will have 4. To complete the addition Press the "Add Shortcut" button 5. </P>

<P>Note that a short cut can not be edited once it has been created. You must delete the shortcut you want to change, and create a new one. Pressing the "Restore Default" button 6, will delete any custom shortcuts you have made. These changes will be permanent once you press the "OK" button. If you press "Cancel" the changes will be discarded.</P>

<P>Note that the Restore Default button 6, resets the settings on all 3 tabs at the same time. It does not only reset the settings on the tab which you are currently viewing.  These changes will be permanent once you press the "OK" button. If you press "Cancel" the changes will be discarded.</P>
